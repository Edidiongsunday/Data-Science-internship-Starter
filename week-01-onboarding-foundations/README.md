# Week 1: Onboarding & Foundations

## Overview
Welcome to the Virtual Data Science Internship! This week is all about getting comfortable with the tools, understanding what data science is, and exploring your learning path.

## Weekly Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Set up your development environment (Git, GitHub, Python, VS Code)
- Understand the fundamentals of data science
- Familiarize yourself with the internship structure and expectations
- Create your first GitHub commit

## Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup (30 min)
- [ ] Install Python 3.8+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- [ ] Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
- [ ] Create a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/)
- [ ] Install VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [ ] Install the Python extension in VS Code

### 2. Git & GitHub Basics (45 min)
- [ ] Learn basic Git commands (git clone, git add, git commit, git push)
- [ ] Fork and clone this repository
- [ ] Create your first branch: `git checkout -b week-01-setup`
- [ ] Make at least 1 commit this week

### 3. Data Science Fundamentals (1 hour)
- [ ] Understand: What is Data Science? (Data Collection → Processing → Analysis → Insights)
- [ ] Know the roles: Data Analyst, Data Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Scientist
- [ ] Identify the Data Science lifecycle: Problem Definition, Data Collection, EDA, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment

### 4. Complete the Reflection Exercise (30 min)
- [ ] Open `reflections.md`
- [ ] Answer the reflection questions thoughtfully
- [ ] Save and commit your work

## Resources

### For Git & GitHub
- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
- [Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git)

### For Data Science Basics
- [What is Data Science?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-science)
- [Data Science Lifecycle](https://www.datahubbs.com/data-science-process/)

## Submission Checklist
- [ ] Repository is forked and cloned
- [ ] First Git commit made (with descriptive message)
- [ ] `reflections.md` completed
- [ ] At least 3 commits pushed to GitHub this week
- [ ] No errors in any code

## Tips for Success
- **Don't rush**: Take time to understand Git properly - it's crucial for the rest of the internship
- **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, that's normal! Reach out to your mentor
- **Document learning**: Write notes as you learn new concepts
- **Commit often**: Small, frequent commits are better than large ones

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Q: I forgot my GitHub password
**A:** Use SSH keys or GitHub's personal access tokens for authentication. [Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication)

### Q: My git command isn't working
**A:** Make sure Git is installed and added to your PATH. Run `git --version` to verify.

### Q: Python isn't recognized in terminal
**A:** Reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
