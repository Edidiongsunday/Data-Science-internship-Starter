# Week 2: Python Fundamentals

## Overview
This week, you'll build a solid foundation in Python programming. Python is the primary language for data science, so mastering these fundamentals is crucial!

## Weekly Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Understand Python data types (strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries, tuples)
- Write functions and understand scope
- Use control flow (if/else, loops)
- Work with lists and dictionaries effectively
- Write clean, readable Python code
- Use list comprehensions

## Tasks

### 1. Python Basics (2 hours)
- [ ] Learn about data types: int, float, string, bool
- [ ] Understand variable naming conventions
- [ ] Practice type conversion
- [ ] Work with the built-in `print()` and `input()` functions

### 2. Control Flow (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Master if/elif/else statements
- [ ] Understand for loops and while loops
- [ ] Practice breaking and continuing loops
- [ ] Solve at least 5 control flow problems

### 3. Data Structures (2 hours)
- [ ] Work with lists: append, extend, insert, remove, pop, slice
- [ ] Understand list indexing and negative indexing
- [ ] Practice dictionaries: keys, values, items, get()
- [ ] Learn when to use lists vs. dictionaries
- [ ] Explore tuples and sets

### 4. Functions (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Define functions with parameters and return values
- [ ] Understand default parameters and *args, **kwargs
- [ ] Practice function naming and documentation
- [ ] Write at least 10 functions this week

### 5. Complete python_practice.ipynb
- [ ] Work through all exercises in the notebook
- [ ] Run all code cells successfully
- [ ] Add your own examples and comments
- [ ] Make at least 3 commits this week

## Key Concepts to Master
| Concept | Importance | Mastery Tips |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Data Types | Critical | Practice type conversion and understand mutability |
| Lists & Dictionaries | Critical | Use daily - they're fundamental to data science |
| Functions | Critical | Write many functions, understand scope |
| Control Flow | Important | Practice nested loops and conditionals |
| List Comprehensions | Important | Come back to this after loops - game changer! |

## Submission Checklist
- [ ] All exercises in `python_practice.ipynb` completed
- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] Clear comments explaining your code
- [ ] At least 3 commits this week
- [ ] Notebook has markdown explanations for each section
- [ ] No syntax errors

## Practice Problems
Complete at least 3 of these while learning (write your solutions as functions):

1. **FizzBuzz**: Print numbers 1-100, but multiples of 3 print "Fizz", multiples of 5 print "Buzz", both print "FizzBuzz"
2. **Reverse String**: Write a function that reverses a string
3. **List Sum**: Write a function that sums all numbers in a list
4. **Dictionary Lookup**: Create a dictionary of 5 countries and their capitals, then build a function to look them up
5. **Remove Duplicates**: Write a function that removes duplicates from a list

## Tips for Success
- **Type along, don't copy-paste**: Typing helps your muscle memory
- **Experiment in the Python REPL**: Use `python` command to test code interactively
- **Break problems into smaller functions**: Don't write one huge function
- **Use meaningful variable names**: `user_age` is better than `ua` or `a`
- **Comment your code**: Explain the "why", not the "what"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Modifying list while iterating | Use list comprehension or iterate over a copy |
| Mutable default parameters | Use None as default, then set inside function |
| Confusing = and == | = assigns, == compares |
| Index out of range errors | Remember Python uses 0-based indexing |
| Not understanding scope | Variables created in functions don't exist outside them |
